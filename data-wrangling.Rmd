```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Import example data:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/master/height.csv")
head(df, 2)
```

# Base R

## Select

We can select observations and columns in base R as follows:


```{r}
# select rows (observations) 1 to 4 and columns 1 to 2
df[1:4, 1:2]
```


```{r}
# Select all observations and columns 3 to 4
df[ , 3:4]
```


```{r}
# Select rows 1 to 4 and all columns
df[1:4, ]
```


## Create new variables

```{r}
# Examples of how to create new variables

# duplicate a variable
df$id_2 <- df$id

# create new variable with value "20" in every row
df$new <- 20

# create new variable with value "new" in every row
df$new_2 <- "new"

# create new variable with sequence from 1 to 20 using seq() 
df$new_id <- seq(1:20)

# create new variable 1 to 20 using c(:) 
df$new_id_2 <- c(1:20)


head(df, 20)
```

```{r}
str(df)
```

## Delete variable

```{r}
# Delete variable
df$id_2 <- NULL

head(df, 3)
```


## Rename variable

```{r}
# Rename columns examples

# By name
names(df)[names(df) == "new_id_2"] <- "ID"

# By index ... index starts with 1... 1 equals variable "Name"
names(df)[1] <- "Name"

head(df, 2)
```

## Change data type

```{r}
# Change data type

# As factor
df$id <- as.factor(df$id)

# As factor
df$gender_2 <- as.factor(df$gender)

# As numeric
df$ID <- as.numeric(df$ID)


str(df)
```

```{r}
df
```


```{r}
# Add new ordinal scaled variable "health"
df$health <-  c("Poor", "Improved", "Excellent", "Poor", "Poor", "Improved", "Excellent", "Poor", "Excellent", "Poor", "Improved", "Excellent", "Poor", "Poor", "Improved", "Excellent", "Poor", "Excellent", NA, NA)

# Change data type to ordered factor
df$health <- factor(df$health, order=TRUE) # when no order is provided, order is alphabetical

str(df$health)
```

```{r}
head(df)
```


```{r}
# specify the levels of the ordered categorical variable

df$health <- factor(df$health, ordered=TRUE, levels = c("Poor", "Improved", "Excellent"))

str(df$health)

```

## Missing values

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use `is.na()`:

```{r}
is.na(df)
```


```{r}
sum(is.na(df))

```


```{r}
sum(is.na(df$health))
```


# dplyr 

## Select columns

There are a number of helper functions you can use within select():

* starts_with("abc"): matches names that begin with “abc”.

* ends_with("xyz"): matches names that end with “xyz”.

* contains("ijk"): matches names that contain “ijk”.

* matches("(.)\\1"): selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters. You’ll learn more about regular expressions in strings.

* num_range("x", 1:3): matches x1, x2 and x3.

```{r}
# Drop columns by name

# drop height
select(df,-height)

# drop height and gender
select(df,-c(height, gender))

# drop hby index
select(df,-c(2))
```

```{r}
select(df, starts_with("gen"))
```


```{r}
select(df, ends_with("er"))
```


```{r}
# Select columns whose name matches a regular expression
select(df, matches("he."))
```


```{r}
# Select columns whose name matches a regular expression
select(df, matches(".ei."))
```

```{r}
# Select range of columns

# create variables to demonstrate num_range
df$x1 <- c(rnorm(20)) 
df$x3 <- c(seq(1:20)) 

# Select columns named x1, x2

select(df, num_range("x", 1))
```

```{r}
df
```


## Rename

```{r}
# rename(df, new_name = old_name)
rename(df, avg_height = average_height_parents)
```

## Filter rows

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with "and": every expression must be true in order for a row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations, you'll need to use Boolean operators yourself: 

* `&` is "and", 
* `|` is "or", and 
* `!` is "not". 

```{r bool-ops, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Complete set of boolean operations. `x` is the left-hand circle, `y` is the right-hand circle, and the shaded region show which parts each operator selects. Source: Wickham & Grolemund 2016"}

knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/transform-logical.png")
```


```{r}
# Extract rows that meet logical criteria.
filter(df, height > 167)
```

## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

`arrange()` works similarly to `filter()` except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order. 

```{r}
arrange(df, average_height_parents, id)
```

Use `desc()` to re-order by a column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(df, desc(height))
```

Missing values are always sorted at the end:

```{r}
df_2 <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df_2, x)
arrange(df_2, desc(x))
```



## Group by and count 

```{r}
df_group_gender <- group_by(df, gender)

summarize(df_group_gender, count=n())
```


```{r}
# count number of cases 
df %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%   
  summarise(count = n())
```

```{r}
# tally() is short-hand for summarise()
df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  tally()
```

```{r}
# count() is a short-hand for group_by() + tally()
count(df, gender)
```


```{r}
# add_count() is a short-hand for group_by() + add_tally() and add to df
df %>% add_count(gender)
```


```{r}
# Note that if the data is already grouped, count() adds
# an additional group that is removed afterwards

df %>% group_by(gender) %>% count(health)
```



```{r}
# Compute new variables by group and add to dataframe
df %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%   
  mutate(avg = mean(height))
```


```{r}
# Compute new variables by group and show summarized result

df %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%                # group gender
  summarise(avg = mean(height)) %>%   # calculate mean and summarize by group
  arrange(desc(avg))                  # order values
```

## Conditional statements

```{r}
# Use conditions to create new variables
df$height_text <- as.factor(if_else(df$height > 165, "tall", "small"))


head(df, 5)
```


```{r}
# Compute new variables with multiple if_else condition
df$gender_dummy <- if_else(df$gender == 'female', 1, 
                    if_else(df$gender == 'male', 0,
                      3))

head(df, 3)
```

```{r}

# Compute new variables with multiple if_else condition
df$con <- if_else(df$height < 160 | df$average_height_parents < 160, "small", 
             if_else(df$height > 164 | df$average_height_parents > 164, "tall",
                     "other"))

select(df, c(height, average_height_parents, con))
```

```{r}
# Compute new variables with multiple if_else condition
df$cond <- if_else(df$gender == 'female' & df$height >= 165, "taller", 
            if_else(df$gender == 'female' & df$height < 165, "tall", 
             if_else(df$gender == 'male' & df$height == 168, "tallest",
                     "other")))

select(df, c(gender, height, cond))
```


# Tidy data

Source: Wickham & Grolemund (2016)


There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

* Each variable must have its own column.
* Each observation must have its own row.
* Each value must have its own cell.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table1 <-  table1
table1
```

## Gathering

A common problem is a dataset where some of the column names are not names of variables, but values of a variable. Take table4a: the column names 1999 and 2000 represent values of the year variable, and each row represents two observations, not one.

```{r}
table4a
```

To tidy a dataset like this, we need to gather those columns into a new pair of variables. To describe that operation we need three parameters:

* The set of columns that represent values, not variables. In this example, those are the columns 1999 and 2000.

* The name of the variable whose values form the column names. I call that the key, and here it is year.

* The name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells. I call that value, and here it’s the number of cases.

* Together those parameters generate the call to gather():



```{r tidy-gather, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Gathering `table4` into a tidy form."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-9.png")
```

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

Note: “1999” and “2000” are non-syntactic names (because they don’t start with a letter) so we have to surround them in backticks.

## Spreading


Spreading is the opposite of gathering. You use it when an observation is scattered across multiple rows. For example, take `table2`: an observation is a country in a year, but each observation is spread across two rows.

```{r}
table2
```

To tidy this up, we first analyse the representation in similar way to `gather()`. This time, however, we only need two parameters:

* The column that contains variable names, the `key` column. Here, it's 
  `type`.

* The column that contains values from multiple variables, the `value`
  column. Here it's `count`.



```{r}
table2 %>%
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```



```{r tidy-spread, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spreading `table2` makes it tidy. Source: Wickham & Grolemund 2016"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-8.png")
```


As you might have guessed from the common `key` and `value` arguments, `spread()` and `gather()` are complements. `gather()` makes wide tables narrower and longer; `spread()` makes long tables shorter and wider.

# Missing Values


```{r}
library(dplyr)
df %>% filter(complete.cases(.))
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df %>% na.omit
```


```{r}
library(tidyr)
df %>% drop_na
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
df %>% filter(!is.na(Name))
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
df %>% filter(is.na(health))
```


```{r}
library(tidyr)
df %>% drop_na(height)
```
